count how many times the letter "s" appears in "I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary! [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food, he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps in Garys food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places, too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10:00! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! [Begins active writing] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now let’s see how it looks so far. "The-" [shows he has only written "the" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think, SpongeBob, think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up]"
